/* the number of servers can vary from 1 to 3 but they
 * all have to be started before interaction. All of them compute
 * the RPC calls and return results, but only one of the results is communicated.
 * however, there is fault tolerance, as long as there is a server the
 * dialogue goes on. The server failure is communicated to clients as exeptions
 * Each client has a preferred server  but it it goes down, some other server
 * is chosen.The ClientServerMapping is the one used to decide on preferred server
 * imagine this library being replaced by a server, server thatd ynamically decides the
 * allocation
 * 
 * cathy gets events with variable delay - jitter. But in the console based demo
 * I could not reproduce it. have to investigate further
