/* the number of servers can vary from 1 to 3 but they
 * all have to be started before interaction. All of them compute
 * the RPC calls and return results, but a server computes the results of onlt
 * the client mapped to it statically by the sttaic methods of ClientServerMapping
 * called by each server
 * so if the server of a client dies, there is no server to service its leave call or to inform it
 * of new clients
 * actually clients are informed but the words of robert frost message is not received
 * let us dig deep into this
 * ah, that is because it is p2p and each connection triggers the connect message
 * but the join awareness is through session manager
 * but the interaction should continue as this is P2P
 *  The server failure is communicated to clients as exeptions 
 * since this is P2P, the interaction does not stop when all severs go away
 * just that more people cannot join the session
 * so one should incrementally bring up the clients in that case to demo this facility
 * very cool
