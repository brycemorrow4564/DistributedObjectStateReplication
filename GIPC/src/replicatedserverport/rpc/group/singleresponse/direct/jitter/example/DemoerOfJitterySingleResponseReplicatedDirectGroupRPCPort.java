/* the number of servers can vary from 1 to 3 but they
 * all have to be started before interaction. All of them compute
 * the RPC calls, but only one sends a result. 
 * however, there is fault tolerance, as long as there is a server the
 * dialogue goes on. The server failure is communicated to clients as exeptions 
 * since this is P2P, the interaction does not stop when all severs go away
 * just that more people cannot join the session
 * so one should incrementally bring up the clients in that case to demo this facility
 * very cool
 * 
 * did notice any delays or jitter in the console I/O
