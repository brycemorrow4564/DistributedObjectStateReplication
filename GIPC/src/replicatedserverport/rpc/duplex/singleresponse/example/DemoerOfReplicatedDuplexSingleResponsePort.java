/* the number of servers can vary from 1 to 3 but they
 * all have to be started before interaction. All of them compute
 * the RPC calls, but only one of them returns results
 * however, there is fault tolerance, as long as there is a server the
 * dialogue goes on. The server failire is communicated to clients as exeptions
 * This is duplex because each server sends results back to only its caller, I suppose the
 * communication goes directly.Will have to check. Perhaps because there is no group call
 * if results are sent back, they are done individually not ina  group call
 * how is single response different from earliest response?
 * maybe it means it is always a particular server or the earliest server
